Here is my plan for DD1 so far

(unfinished)I will catch up the contents in lectures on Wednesday and Thursday.


07-15
Tomorrow Sunday from 8:30 to 11:00 a.m., I have a Buddism discussion online. 
1:30-4:30 p.m., I have a Buddism discussion in someone's house. (you can think it like a Chistian family meeting)
Monday the speech is on 11:00 a.m..

I will put what I have done here.
